# --------------------------------------------#
# This script checks one or all existing Let's Encrypt SSL certificate(s) for
# expiration, renews it/them if necessary and optionally restarts webserver
# (configurable option, see below).
# This script does NOT mess with you Nginx/Apache config files, they remain untouched
# (there is no need to modify them, since symlinks in /etc/letsencrypt/live directories
# always point to the most recent certificate).
# 
# Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 3 monts, so we should
# renew them approx. every 2 months to avoid near-expiry-date problems.
#
# USAGE:
#  -h or --help : Help message
#  --renew-all  : Check all LE certificates and renew them if necessary.
#                 Before you run it with this option, check configuration
#                 block below to be sure that you have correct paths,
#                 expiration limit and email settings.
#  CERT_NAME    : Check specific certificate and renew it if necessary.
#                 Script will search for a renewal configuration file
#                 in /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/CERT_NAME.conf and extract
#                 list of domains that are included in the certificate.
#                 Before you run this command, check that these files exist:
#                 /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/CERT_NAME.conf
#                 /etc/letsencrypt/live/CERT_NAME/cert.pem
#                 If these files do not exist an error message will be shown.
#
# In case at least one certificate was renewed during script execution,
# a $CMD_SRV_RESTART command will be executed (useful for reloading webserver,
# or any other services that use LE certificates (see configuration block).
# If renewal of a certificate fails, an alert email will be sent.
#
# LE client logs all errors automatically to this file:
# /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
#
# Return codes: if used with --renew-all, then script always returns 0,
# because we can't determine whether renewal of individual certificates caused
# any errors. If used without --renew-all option, returns 0 if certificated
# does not need to be renewed or if certificate was successfully renewed.
# Returns 1 on errors (certificate file not found, renewal failed).

## --------------------------------------------
#
# Update history:
#
# 03.12.2015 v1.0
# The very first version. Does not support multiple-domain certificates.
#
# 05.12.2015 v1.1
# Support for multiple-domain certificates. If used as script_name <CERT_NAME>,
# takes domain list from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/CERT_NAME.conf file
#
# 08.12.2015 v1.2
# No bug fixing, typo corrections and small code improvements.
#
# 25.12.2015 v1.3
# Removed superfluous "sync" from CMD_SRV_RESTART. Thanks to allo and TCM from Let's Encrypt forums.
